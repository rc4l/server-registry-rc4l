// [rc4l] The caching layer in front of serverregistries.txt.
//
// GitHub holds the source of truth (edited by pull request); this Worker is what CLIENTS actually
// fetch. Cloudflare serves it from cache, so a hundred thousand players cost GitHub nothing and the
// file stays reviewable in git.
//
// Two properties matter more than anything else here:
//
//   1. It must never answer 200 with something that is not a list. A client treats "parsed zero
//      entries" as a failed fetch and keeps its cache, but only if we don't hand it a 200 that looks
//      authoritative. Upstream trouble therefore becomes a 5xx, never an empty success.
//
//   2. It must never challenge. A game client cannot solve a CAPTCHA or run a JS interstitial, so a
//      bot challenge on this hostname is indistinguishable from an outage -- and it lands hardest on
//      shared and CGNAT address ranges, which is most of the world outside the US. Challenges are
//      disabled for this hostname in the dashboard; see README.md. This file cannot enforce that, so
//      it is written down in both places.
